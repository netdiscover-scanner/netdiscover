.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnetdiscover\fP is an active/passive ARP reconnaissance tool, initially developed
to gain information about wireless networks without DHCP servers in wardriving
scenarios. It can also be used on switched networks. Built on top of libnet
and libpcap, it can passively detect online hosts or search for them by
sending ARP requests.
.PP
Furthermore, it can be used to inspect your network's ARP traffic, or find
network addresses using auto scan mode, which will scan for common local
networks.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP \fIdevice\fP
The network interface to sniff and inject packets. If no interface
is specified, first available will be used.
.TP
.B
\fB-r\fP \fIrange\fP
Scan a given \fIrange\fP instead of auto scan. Valid \fIrange\fP values include,
for example: 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.2.0/23, 192.168.0.0/12,
192.168.0.0/8. Note that \fBnetdiscover\fP is also a passive scanner, and
all detected IPs will be displayed, in addition to those included in
the specified \fIrange\fP.
.TP
.B
\fB-l\fP \fIfile\fP
Scan ranges contained on the given \fIfile\fP. It must contain only one
\fIrange\fP per line.
.TP
.B
\fB-p\fP
Enable passive mode. In passive mode, \fBnetdiscover\fP does not send
anything, but does only sniff.
.TP
.B
\fB-m\fP \fIfile\fP
Scan a list of known MACs and host names.
.TP
.B
\fB-F\fP \fIfilter\fP
Customize pcap \fIfilter\fP expression (default: "arp").
.TP
.B
\fB-s\fP \fItime\fP
Sleep given \fItime\fP in milliseconds between each ARP request
injection. (default 1)
.TP
.B
\fB-c\fP \fIcount\fP
Number of times to send each ARP request. Useful for networks with
packet loss, so it will scan given times for each host. (default 1)
.TP
.B
\fB-n\fP \fInode\fP
Last IP octet of the source IP used for scanning. You can change
it if the default host (x.x.x.67) is already used. (allowed \fIrange\fP
is 2 to 253, default 67)
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP
Ignore configuration files at home dir (for autoscan and fast mode
only). This will use default ranges and IPs for autoscan and fast
mode. See below for information about configuration files.
.TP
.B
\fB-R\fP
Assume user is root or that he has the required capabilities
without running any checks.
.TP
.B
\fB-f\fP
Enable fast mode scan. This will only scan for .1, .100 and .254
on each network. This mode is useful while searching for ranges
being used. After you found such \fIrange\fP you can make a specific
\fIrange\fP scan to find online boxes.
.TP
.B
\fB-P\fP
Produces an output suitable to be redirected into a \fIfile\fP or to be
parsed by another program, instead of using interactive mode.
Enabling this option, \fBnetdiscover\fP will stop after scanning given
ranges.
.TP
.B
\fB-L\fP
Similar to \fB-P\fP but continue program execution to capture ARP packets
passively after the active scan.
phase to capture ARP packets passively.
.TP
.B
\fB-N\fP
Do not print header. Only valid when \fB-P\fP or \fB-L\fP is enabled.
.TP
.B
\fB-S\fP
(DEPRECATED) Enable sleep \fItime\fP suppression between each request.
If set, \fBnetdiscover\fP will sleep after having scanned 255 hosts
instead of sleeping after each one. This mode was used in
\fBnetdiscover\fP 0.3 beta4 and before. Avoid this option in networks
with packet loss, or in wireless networks with low signal
level. (also called hardcore mode)
.SH USAGE
If passive mode (\fB-p\fP), scan list (\fB-l\fP) or scan \fIrange\fP (\fB-r\fP) options aren't
enabled, \fBnetdiscover\fP will scan for common LAN addresses (192.168.0.0/16,
172.16.0.0/12 and 10.0.0.0/8).

.SH CONFIG FILES
There are 2 configuration files that \fBnetdiscover\fP will look for, each \fItime\fP it
is executed. If files doesn't exist, \fBnetdiscover\fP will use default values. You
can use the \fB-d\fP switch to disable reading and loading configuration files.
.TP
.B
~/.\fBnetdiscover\fP/ranges
This \fIfile\fP contains a list of ranges (one per line) used for auto scan
mode instead of default ranges. By default \fBnetdiscover\fP will use a list
of common ranges used on local networks.

Example:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    192.168.21.0/24
    172.24.0.0/14

.TP
.B
~/.\fBnetdiscover\fP/fastips
List containing the last octet of the IPs to be scanned on each
subnet, when using fast mode (\fB-f\fP), by default (1,100,154). You must
put a number per line.
.SH USAGE EXAMPLES
Scan common LAN addresses on eth0:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # netdiscover -i eth0

.fam T
.fi
Fast scan common LAN addresses on eth0 (search only for gateways):
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # netdiscover -i eth0 -f

.fam T
.fi
Scan some fixed ranges:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # netdiscover -i eth0 -r 172.26.0.0/24
    # netdiscover -r 192.168.0.0/16
    # netdiscover -r 10.0.0.0/8

.fam T
.fi
Scan common LAN addresses with sleep \fItime\fP 0.5 milliseconds instead of
default 1:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # netdiscover -s 0.5

.fam T
.fi
Scan fixed \fIrange\fP on fast mode with sleep \fItime\fP 0.5 milliseconds instead of
default 1:
.PP

    # netdiscover -r 192.168.0.0/16 -f -s 0.5

.fam T
.fi
Scan a \fIrange\fP using 101 as last octet for SOURCE IP
.PP
.nf
.fam C
    # netdiscover -r 10.1.0.0/16 -n 101

.fi
Only sniff for ARP traffic, don't send nothing:
