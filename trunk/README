Welcome to Netdiscover 0.3 beta. Netdiscover is a network address discovering
tool, developed mainly for those wireless networks without dhcp server, but it
also works on hub/switched networks. Its based on arp requests, it will send arp
requests and sniff for replys.

Its my first public C tool, so dont be too hard with me, if some parts on the
code looks like offuscated or are unreadable, and feel free to mail me with 
suggestions or patches at <jpenalbae@gmail.com>

Also mail me for any bug or compilation error, it must compile with gcc 2.95 or
newer.
